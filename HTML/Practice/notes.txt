Use Browser Dev Tools to figure out other people's HTML
Format your codes, different ID elements can give different styling to their own 
Global CSS values
Pseudo class to change the style of some elements (selector)
Add shared css files first to each pages and then specific styling css files afterwards
Specificity: more specific selector's rule wins over less specific sleector (following inheritance rules)
CSS Box Model: 
+ Each elements has their own boxes that contains their contents. 
+ Padding: distance between the content and the box border (Top - Right - Bottom - Left)
+ Margin: distance between elements 
Use Selectors and Combinators to easily format codes when things get more complex
(Combinators structure goes selector1 selector2)
(Classes are more specific than combinators or selectors)
Bottom and Top margins dont work with inline elements --> Use display: inline-block element
Margin collapsing: 
+ Only happens with adjacent & vertical elements
+ Overlapping margin, meaning the bigger margin value will be picked
